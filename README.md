# AoC2024 in SETL

[SETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SETL) is an old-school high level
language aiming to make programming more like set theoretic notation.
It is simple and quick to learn. [GNU SETL](https://setl.org/setl/) is
the only active interpretor I came across. 

SETL has powerful list comprehensions for building tuples and sets, 
compounding operators and little else besides of surprise to a Python
coder. I really like its simplicitly. My main motive was to see how it
felt to reason mostly in set theoretic terms and solve problems with
list comprehensions.

The initial commit includes problems 1-5. I'll add more as I go.
